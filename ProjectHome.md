**PLEASE NOTE: RestFB has transitioned off of Google Code and onto Github - the project's new home is [http://github.com/revetkn/restfb](http://github.com/revetkn/restfb).**

RestFB is a simple and flexible Java [Facebook Graph API](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api) and [Old REST API](http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/API) client.  Version 1.6.10 of the library was released on September 3, 2012.  If you're a Maven user, you'll be glad to know that RestFB is now available in the Maven central repository.

Please visit the official RestFB homepage at http://restfb.com for documentation and code examples.  There's also a [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/restfb) where you can interact with other members of the RestFB community, ask for help, and share tips and usage examples.

Continued development of RestFB is sponsored by [Transmogrify, LLC](http://xmog.com).
